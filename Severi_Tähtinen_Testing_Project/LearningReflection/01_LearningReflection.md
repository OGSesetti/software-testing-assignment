> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- It was interesting to find out how the registration page was programmed.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I wrote most of my ideas on paper at first and then wrote them into more detailed instructions on my PC
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - I still feel too inexperienced to recommend anything.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- Just Visual Studio Code


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- No trouble


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I haven't used Github in this assignment at the point of writing this. However I use Github for my personal projects all the time so I doubt there will be any trouble.

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I have some experience with Robot Framework, so I suppose I would start from there.



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- It seems like companies are mostly interested in experience in the different test automation frameworks.



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- I most definitely need more experience when it comes to automation testing.




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- I do feel like this project "broke the ice" in a way, when it comes to software testing in practice. I'm sure I am going to remember everything I learned on this course a lot better now that I've had to apply this knowledge in practice.

I think the course was overall good. The written material in the eBooks was at times extremely poorly written though. I often felt like an entire page of confusing text in the book was ended up being something that a Google search result was able to explain in two sentences. The video material in Percipio really saved me.

I also feel like at times (and especially in the quizzes) it was a lot harder to understand the questions than it was to answer them, either due to grammatical errors or the use of excessively rare and difficult vocabulary. I don't remember ever having this much trouble understanding English in anything I have studied. (Even English) 
Example: One of the quizzes had a question that went like this: 
"Which type of test design techniques does the following statement best describes a procedure to derive test cases based on the specification of a component?"
I believe it would be a great improvement to keep the questions as linguistically simple as possible, since we don't have that many native speakers anyway.
